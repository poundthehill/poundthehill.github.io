title: "DC's Best Premium Coffee and Tea"
---

**Pound doesn’t settle.** Coffee, tea or food, nothing gets served unless it’s the best possible product we can put out. That’s why Pound is proud to be to serve [PT’s Coffee Roasting Co.](www.ptscoffee.com), the **2009 Macro Roaster of the Year** (i.e. it doesn’t get any better than this). Like tea? You will love our collection of **gourmet Mighty Leaf teas.**
Are you a fan of unique, handcrafted drinks? Second only to our pride in quality is our creative passion. Pound has created several unique, specialty drinks that you will only find here. Our **Nutella latte** (pictured) is a MUST have. As the weather warms up, our *fruit smoothies* and frozen blended drinks really hit the spot!
Did I mention we have perfected the Nutella latte? Only at Pound.
