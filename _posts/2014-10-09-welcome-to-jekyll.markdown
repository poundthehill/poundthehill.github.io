###Pound The Hill has been revised to make you happier!

- No more closing from 4-5pm, you can stay!
- Beer, wine and an even more improved food menu available through lunch and dinner
- Breakfast ALL day everyday, as it should be!
- Happy Hour from 4-7pm throughout the restaurant. Inside or out.
- Your friendly baristas and bartenders will take your orders and bring your food, but we no longer have waited table service or take reservations.
